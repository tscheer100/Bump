# Bump Bot
A discord bot created to remind users to bump the server 2 hours after the previous bump.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.X
- [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- [Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)

### What I've learned from this project
- the benefits of using `asyncio` over `time.sleep`
